# Local Library Ts 


This project was inspired in a tutorial project made in [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). It makes you practice the basic concepts you will need in order to build an application's back-end. The tutorial used an older javascript version, and since I was willing to practice javascript, 
I decided to give this project my own touch rebuilding it with typescript.
